The 2023 European Bioinformatics Community for Mass Spectrometry (EuBIC-MS) Developers Meeting was held from January 15th to January 20th, 2023, in Congressi Stefano Franscin at Monte Verit√† in Ticino, Switzerland. The participants were scientists and developers working in computational mass spectrometry (MS), metabolomics, and proteomics. The 5-day program was split between introductory keynote lectures and parallel hackathon sessions focusing on ``Artificial Intelligence in proteomics'' to stimulate future directions in the MS-driven omics areas. During the latter, the participants developed bioinformatics tools and resources addressing outstanding needs in the community. The hackathons allowed less experienced participants to learn from more advanced computational MS experts and actively contribute to highly relevant research projects. We successfully produced several new tools applicable to the proteomics community by improving data analysis and facilitating future research.
