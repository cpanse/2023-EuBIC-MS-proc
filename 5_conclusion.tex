\section{Conclusion and outlook}
The EuBIC-MS Developers Meeting 2023 follows the successful previous winter schools and developers meetings.

In a follow-up survey, 50\% of the participants expressed their overall satisfaction with the meeting, with two-thirds of the survey respondents giving it a perfect score (5) and one-third a good score (4).
Overall, opinions varied, with a significant portion favoring either more leisure time or more organized activities, while a notable percentage found the existing balance to be satisfactory.
    
The EuBIC developer's meeting, spanning a few days, witnessed substantial progress in hackathon sessions across all projects, showcasing participants' impressive productivity and teamwork. The commitment of hackathon groups to ongoing collaboration and project completion holds promise for future scientific publications and improved computational mass spectrometric solutions to support proteomics and metabolomics.

Encouraged by the community's enthusiastic support, the next EuBIC-MS event will take place in January 2024 in Winterberg, Germany.
